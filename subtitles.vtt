What does it mean to be human if we don't have a shared culture?
And what does a shared culture mean if you can't share it?

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.750
It's only in the last 100, or 150 years or so,
that we started tightly restricting how that culture gets used.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.000
The Internet enabled an infrastructure where
anybody could participate without asking permission.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:25.250
We have all these new technologies that allow people to express themselves,
take control of their own creative impulses, but the law's getting in the way.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:33.250
Creative Commons is designed to save the world from failed sharing.
People who actually want to share stuff.
Who put it up on the web because they want to share it under certain terms.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:42.000
So we wanted to create a simple way, for creators
to say to the world here's the freedom that I want to run with my creative work.
Here are the things you're allowed to do.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.250
Can I reproduce it, can I copy it, can I put it in my text book?
Can I use that photograph? Can I make a new version of it?

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.500
Creative Commons gives tools to creators to make a choice about copyright.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.000
Creative Commons licence can cover anything that copyright covers.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.500
Every licence says "You need to give me attribution.
I created this, give me credit for the work I did."

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:14.750
The basic choices are commercial use, or not.
Can you make derivative works, versions, adaptations or not?
And do you want me to have to share alike?
So if I take your stuff, do I have to offer it to the next person
under the same terms?

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:27.500
There's no requirement for you to do anything with your work
other than what you want to do.
You own the copyright to it. What we've done is given you the right
to exercise your copyright in more ways, more simply.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:34.500
So the idea here is to enable the creative impulses
that the technology turns loose,
and get the law out of the way.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:42.500
The work of Creative Commons is really about laying the infrastructure
and ground work for this new type of culture.
A new kind of Folk Culture.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:55.250
Somebody from Deli, somebody from New York, somebody from Singapore,
can feel comfortable using a photo that was created
and given away by somebody in The United States, or in China,
or wherever that the licenses have been extended to.

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.750
With their identity being preserved.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.500
Which means that people can actually create new kinds of things,
come together and build things.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.750
Mash-ups that people can do with peopleâ€™s Flicker photos.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.000
And CCmixter has allowed artists to make music together.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.250
It's really about creativity and connection.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.500
Access and control.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:22.250
From amateurs who simply for the love of what they are doing,
and they want to share it,
and they want other people to be able to make use of it,
to commercial organizations.

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.500
In the end, this will have a very successful place in the for profit economy.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:42.750
Creative Commons is the bridge to this future.
You've got to move away from thinking about content
to thinking about communities.
Communities that develop around content
and the sharing that the licences allow
enable these communities to come together.

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:50.250
A physical Commons like a park where anybody can enter equally.
A Commons with intellectual works is actually much freer.

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.250
It really is going to be the pillar for communications
between people, cultural exchanges.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.250
The space for more speech, more free expression,

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.000
And that's the kind of Commons we're trying to create.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
